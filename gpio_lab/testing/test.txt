** switch case statement

- heartbeat LED blinks at a fixed 1 Hz while main() is being executed. 
    - Issue a LOG_INF() statement each time the heartbeat LED is toggled.

test 1:
in init state ...
  - check that gpio0 interface is ready
  - check that all led output pins are initialized 

test 2:
check transition to default state

test 3:
in default state ...
  - check that buzzer_led and iv_pump_led are blinking out of phase with one another at 2 Hz
  - check heartbeat led blinking at 1 Hz
  - check that the error led is off

test 4:
check transition to blink state

test 5:
in blink state, decrement action led by 1 hz (press freq down button)
  - check the action led blink frequency is 1 hz 
  - check heartbeat led blinking at 1 Hz
  - check action leds blinking out of phase 

test 6:
in blink state, decrement action led by 1 hz (press freq down button)
  - check that we transition to error state 
  - error led should be one
  - action led should be off
  - heartbeat LED should be at 1 hz 

test 7:
in error state press reset button
  - check transtion to default state 

test 8:
in blink state, increment action led by 1 hz (press freq up button)
  - check action led freq = 3 hz
  - check heartbeat led blinking at 1 Hz
  - check action leds blinking out of phase 

test 9:
in blink state, increment action led by 1 hz (press freq up button)
  - check action led freq = 4 hz
  - check heartbeat led blinking at 1 Hz
  - check action leds blinking out of phase 

test 10:
in blink state, increment action led by 1 hz (press freq up button)
  - check action led freq = 5 hz
  - check heartbeat led blinking at 1 Hz
  - check action leds blinking out of phase 

test 11:
in blink state, increment action led by 1 hz (press freq up button)
  - check that we transition to error state 
  - error led should be one
  - action led should be off
  - heartbeat LED should be at 1 hz 

test 12:
in error state press reset button
  - check transtion to default state 

test 13:
in blink state, press sleep button
  - check transition to sleep state 

test 14:
in sleep state ...
  - check that blink freq is saved
  - action led off
  - heartbeat led on at 1 hz
  - error led off 

test 15:
in sleep state, press sleep button 
  - check transition to blink state 

test 16:
in blink state, press sleep button to go back to sleep state, 
  - then press reset button and check transtion to reset state
